# cnn-xtensor
Port of a CNN to xtensor for embedded CPU testing purposes.  This contains a stand alone implementation 
of a CNN shamelessly stolen from https://victorzhou.com/blog/intro-to-cnns-part-2/ and ported to xtensor

xtensor and xtensor-blas and portions of FLENS are included using their BSD licenses for ease of cross-compilation.
You would be best advice to get these compiled for your architecture as no SMID or other goodies are enabled.
